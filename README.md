#### Enhance words

An examples of **bold**, _italic_, ~~crossed~~ and some plain text.

#### Coding

You can write inline `code` ore an entire block
```

like this one
```

#### List

Is also possible to make **ordered lists**:

1. first element
2. second element
  1. sub-element

and **unordered list**:

* first element
* second element
  1. is also possible to mix it, but you have to indent
  * this one, in facts, is **ordered** like the first sub-element on this level
    * (this can be **unordered**)
